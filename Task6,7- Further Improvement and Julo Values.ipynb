    "As the person guiding Data Science team, I genuinely care about more than just numbers and outcomes. Our company's mission means a lot to me, but so does respecting and valuing the diverse world we operate in. This means we're not just about complying with the laws; it's also about truly understanding and cherishing the cultures, beliefs, and values of the people we serve. I believe in creating a space where everyone feels seen and respected, where discrimination has no place. It's about listening, caring, and considering the needs and feelings of others in everything we do. We're here to make a positive impact, one that's felt on a truly human level.\n",

An Effective team would be which always aligned with the company goals and mission, thrive to attain milestones but at the same time do not get feel burn out. \n",
    "\n",
    "I always encourage my team to stay transperent and be open to communicate anything with me. Effective team players are the heartbeat of a collaborative and positive environment, where success is a shared journey, not just an individual accomplishment. They bring to the table not only their skills but also an unwavering commitment to work together, understand each other's strengths, and cover for weaknesses. These individuals thrive on mutual respect and open communication, always ready to listen, share ideas, and provide constructive feedback. They celebrate victories together and view challenges as opportunities to grow stronger as a unit. Holding each other accountable, they ensure that every member of the team is moving in the same direction, driven by a common purpose. In essence, effective team players are those who recognize that true success comes from the collective effort, trust, and accountability shared amongst each other.\n",
    "\n",

    "Striving towards excellence is good but sometimes it delays the entire process and delivery. In Corporate culture, you need to be move fast towards delivery start with POC and then present a clear recalibration plan of your models. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when we introduced the Insta Loan product in May, my team was tasked with delivering a scorecard at the time of launch. Instead of waiting for actual customer data to accumulate, we initially utilized proxy data to develop the scorecard. This approach allowed us to meet our launch deadlines efficiently. Then, after two months, once we had gathered a sufficient sample size of customer data, we revisited and refined our model. This strategy ensured that we could provide immediate value while also adapting and improving our model with more precise data over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "***1- We are Critical***\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about our company's value of being critical, pushing each other to think deeper, and being thorough in how we evaluate things, I see an area where I can grow. Sometimes, I might hold back a bit too much when it comes to sharing my own critiques or questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "I really believe in the importance of diving deep and challenging ideas because it's how we get to the best outcomes. But, I admit, there are moments when I worry about stepping on toes or how my input might be taken, especially meeting with CCO or CEOs. I'm actively working on this by reminding myself that our team culture isn't just okay with asking tough questions—it actually welcomes it. I'm learning to trust my own insights more and to remember that voicing them is part of how we all grow together."
